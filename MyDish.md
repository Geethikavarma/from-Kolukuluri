### Geethika Kolukuluri

My Favourite Dish is Butter Naan with Butter Chicken. I Love Eating it. It might be a bit constipated if we continuously eat but the taste is good and it goes very well with the butter Chicken.<br>
The Blunt Taste of Butter Naan and the spice n Sweet taste of Butter Chicken make a good Combination and satisfies the every typical Indian Craving.
